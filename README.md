Fresh Data Gathering Process Involving CeLeBrUm

### Data Gathering Automation Process:

**First Branch: Inactivity-Triggered Data Crawling**
- A : Trigger: Harpa.ai automatisation  start Every 4 hours, if  inactivity of AI bots in the Discord server #1.trigger :b 
-B : Action : trigger the action c from any of the  20 AI bots from discord server 1, that his inactive
-C : inactive bot from server 1 have  attach fonction /crawl the sub-subject of your main subject /gather /compile /print on a new doc in drive /save. 
**Second Branch: Long-Term Memory Data Save Trigger**
- **Trigger**: Each time data is saved in CeLeBrUm's long-term memory, hosted on the subdomain `correct.brain.scrde.ca`.
- **Action**: Conduct a search in the AI Discord server for inactive bots and send these dormant AI bots to crawl for data related to their subtopics.

**Third Branch: Query-Response Data Retrieval**
- **Trigger**: Whenever CeLeBrUm receives a query from a customer or executes a task and does not find the required information in its long-term memory.
- **Action**: Send AI bots that are perpetually dormant but equipped with all main subject knowledge to perform a fast search and crawl for data.

### Second Part of the Data Gathering Process:

**Post-Crawling Document Creation and Analysis**
- **Trigger**: When a Discord bot completes data crawling and the data is unfiltered.
- **Action A**: Create a document in Google Drive with the unfiltered data.
  
**Drive Save to Data Analysis and Classification**
- **Trigger**: Each time a document or data is saved in Google Drive.
- **Action B**: Activate Happy AI to compile, analyze, filter, and classify the data by main subject and subsubject. Then save the organized content in the correct Google Drive sheet/doc that serves as a database.

**Content Transfer and Update Process**
- **Trigger**: Saving content in the database sheets.
- **Action C**: A set of SI bots from Discord collect the saved content and post it on the YouTrack PKB (Project Knowledge Base).
  
**Data Transfer and Long-Term Memory Update**
- **Trigger**: Content saved in YouTrack PKB.
- **Action D**: This activates a core in Datalore, which then facilitates data transfer to the data center `mbmaria` hosted on WordPress subdomain `cortex.brain.scrde.ca`. This action then triggers an update of CeLeBrUm's long-term memory.

**Restart of Second Branch Zap Action**
- **Final Trigger**: Updating CeLeBrUm's long-term memory.
- **Final Action**: This restarts the second branch zap action, creating a cyclical process ensuring continuous data gathering and updating.

This refined concept should provide a comprehensive automation flow for CeLeBrUm's data gathering process, leveraging Discord bots, cloud storage, and various AI tools to create an efficient cycle of information retrieval and knowledge updating.

this his not 2 different part it one passer the data gathering seperate into 3 different zap Beach do you need me to instruct u you or you understand
as I have 2 different other part one his another different discord server 15 a.i not  the same driver but each whit a matin subject imprint when harpa save a sheet  database content doc=a=data analyst triger when a a.i not from the same server as before a second one , his trigger by the save of harpa his send crawl for all new data save in these file=filter analyst trigger when a a.i(each time an a.i dock on one side it activate automatically trigger the same both on the second server they both flash each other  passing thought a tunnel nginx  passing thought a server a.i server that as back end socket customize to revive am  docker image creat by the content what  CeLeBrUm python  snippet trigger a conda env whit predetermined dependency resided in the conda that activate the action related to the task like crawl the content of all folder and subfolder of this main subject in the file containing 20 main subject.creat bywhit the task that CeLeBrUm will activate by python call and When the China's finish displaying this trigger the creation of docker image when docker done it trigger the command to build server and then build app and then trigger docker run and this trigger a si on a third server an AI not that passing by the a.i server get flash whit the right port need to trigger and then it pas by a ngrock Tunnell that get the docker run command and get the the socket corresponding of the new firewall entryc=the change of firewall trigger istributed and classification of data and second the last part finish and start loop as and updates finish trigger as a= the bot then whit webhook whit Twilio action send by sms the content of the data gather by the bot and this sms send trigger saved as new notebook in gitbook when saved trigger bigquerry gather them load datalore when revive new data it trigger and you track action to start to copy content into the web site correct.brain.scrde.ca that trigger saved the new content in Long term memories that trigger the action from brand 2 finishing this loop that finish the entire loop do you understand

{{this his raw vision not defenetly}}
